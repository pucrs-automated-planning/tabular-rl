Reference Jupyter Notebook for Tabular RL

## Environment Set Up

For [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com), we recommend you create a separate environment as follows:

```zsh
conda create -n rl python=3.9
conda activate rl
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

For pip, run the following command:

```zsh
cd tabular-rl
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run Jupyter notebook from the `src` folder:

```zsh
cd src
jupyter notebook
```
